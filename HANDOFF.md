# Handoff

Updated: 2026-10-21 (overnight run)

## Done
- M1 on `m1-plan-and-source` (PR #1): scrubbed page source, example criteria, scan prompt template and renderer, demo seed data, in-memory db mock, demo build, personal-data check plus pre-commit hook, PLAN.md.
- M2 on `m2-core-flow` (stacked on M1):
  - `src/scoring.js`: the criteria rules as a pure module (gates, sector weight, fit, culture, comp, values, clamp, digest caps), 17 unit tests, plus a test that the scan prompt states the same numbers.
  - Page: every card shows how its score was reached; the Criteria tab has a live digest preview that re-ranks as you edit the YAML.
  - Bugs fixed, each with a browser test: stray `<style>` tag that dropped the filter bar's styles; no message when js-yaml fails to load; non-http links from scan data were clickable; `$` patterns in injected data could corrupt the demo build.
  - 8 headless Chromium tests on demo data (all tabs, no console errors, phone width has no sideways scroll).
  - Live private artifact republished with the same page plus `scoring.js` (checked locally against a private copy of the real data: all 62 cards render, no errors).
  - Scan prompt now asks the scan to store `cultureSignals` on new jobs; the daily scan's thread was asked to apply it.
- 35 tests passing.

## In progress
- Nothing. M2 is ready for review.

## Exact next step
- Start M3 on `m3-case-study`, branched from `m2-core-flow`: write `scripts/screenshots.mjs` (Playwright, demo data, light theme, 1200px and 390px), save PNGs to `docs/screenshots/`, then rewrite README.md as the case study.

## How to work here
- `npm install`, then `npm test`, `npm run build:demo` (open `dist/demo.html`).
- Run `npm run hooks` once so the pre-commit privacy check runs.
- For the full check, point `PRIVATE_DENYLIST` at the private denylist kept outside this repo.
- Browser tests use Playwright with the preinstalled Chromium; js-yaml is served from `node_modules` because the CDN may be unreachable.
- The live page is `app/role-radar.html` published with `src/scoring.js` as a supporting file named `scoring.js`.

## Decisions to review
- The repo keeps a demo persona's `criteria.yaml` (fictional comp floors, home state and example companies), not the real one.
- The scan prompt is a template with five placeholders filled from a profile file; the real profile stays out of the repo (`profile.local.json` is gitignored).
- Demo companies and people are invented; job links point to example.com.
- The score breakdown is computed in the page from stored fields. Older jobs have no culture data, so their breakdown can differ from the scan's score; the card then says "scan said N (it also reads the posting)".

## Blockers
- None.
